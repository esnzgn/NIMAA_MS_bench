# Processed PRIDE data sets
Collection of PRIDE data sets that have been re-analyzed with the [WOMBAT-P Pipelines](https://github.com/wombat-p/WOMBAT-pipelines).

Each data set is represented by a folder named as the ProteomeXChange accession number. The subfolder should provide the version of the WOMBAT. 
Please include all standardized output files, the used sdrf file and parameter file (if needed) and the original call of the workflow in form of `.nextflow.log`.
